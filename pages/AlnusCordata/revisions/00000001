Italian Alder - Alnus cordata  4 BGN / 2 Euro / £1.60 per plant
The Italian Alder medium-sized tree grows up to 25 m tall. The leaves are deciduous but with a very long season in leaf, from April to December. Like other members of Alnus genus, it is able to fix nitrogen from the air. It thrives on much drier soils than most other alders, and grows rapidly even under very unfavourable circumstances, which renders it extremely valuable for landscape planting on poor soils and heavily compacted sites. It is commonly grown as a windbreak   To order this plant please contact us balkanecologyproject@gmail.com.

Products, uses

    An excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established 
    Can be planted on land that is compacted and very nutrient poor. 
    An excellent windbreak for maritime areas, it grows quite quickly and establishes well even in very windy sites

Functions, behaviours

    The Italian Alder makes a medium to large bonsai, a quick grower it responds well to pruning with branches ramifying well and leaf size reducing quite rapidly.
    Has a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil.
    Trees can be coppiced.
    Fixes nitrogen via symbiotic relationship with Frankia spp. bacteria
