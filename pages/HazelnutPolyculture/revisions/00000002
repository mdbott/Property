= Corylus avellana - Hazelnut =
Large, fast growing, native, deciduous tree/shrub producing excellent nuts. Very attractive in spring when festooned with many long yellow catkins which are followed by the edible nuts in autumn. The trees make great hedging and are a classic coppice plant producing pliable stems used for many purposes such as bean sticks and wattle fencing.

 . Hardiness Zone: 4 An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, but is in general more productive when grown on soils of moderate fertility.
  . Succeeds in a pH range 4.5 to 8.5, but prefers a range of 5 to 7.

== Known hazards ==
 . none known

== Overview ==
 . Deciduous  Tree growing to 6 m by 3 m at a medium rate.  It is hardy to zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from Jan to April, and the seeds ripen from Sep to October. The flowers are monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils.  Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers moist soil.  The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.

== Characteristics ==
 . form: Standard Tree
 . layer : Lower Canopy
 . habit:  height x width (m): 6 x 3
 . years to bearing nuts : 3-4 yrs
 . productive life span: 50yrs

== Products ==
 . Fruit: Very tasty and nutritious nuts.
 . Wood :  Soft, easy to split, not very durable, beautifully veined. Used for inlay work, small items of furniture, hurdles, wattles, basketry, pea sticks Plants can be grown as a tall hedge. They need to be left untrimmed or only lightly trimmed if seed is required.
 . Medicinal: The bark, leaves, catkins and fruits are sometimes used medicinally

== Functions, behaviours ==
 . Often grown as a coppiced shrub in woodlands, the stems have a variety of uses A tree that has not been coppiced (a standard) can live for about 60 years, but coppiced can live up to 500. Plants are self-fertile but a more certain crop is obtained if more than one cultivar is grown
