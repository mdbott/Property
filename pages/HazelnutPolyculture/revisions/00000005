= Corylus avellana - Hazelnut =
Large, fast growing, native, deciduous tree/shrub producing excellent nuts. Very attractive in spring when festooned with many long yellow catkins which are followed by the edible nuts in autumn. The trees make great hedging and are a classic coppice plant producing pliable stems used for many purposes such as bean sticks and wattle fencing.

== Context ==
 * native region: Europe
 * native habitat: Woods and hedgerows, especially on the slopes of hills.
 * family: Betulaceae

== Predators ==
 . Squirrels feed on the nuts

== Needs, tolerances ==
 * Light: Full sun or Semi shade
 * soil pH:  acid-neutral -basic alkaline
 * Hardiness Zone: 4 An easily grown plant, it succeeds in most soils, but is in general more productive when grown on soils of moderate fertility.
 . Succeeds in a pH range 4.5 to 8.5, but prefers a range of 5 to 7.
 . Plants are fairly wind tolerant

== Known hazards ==
 * none known

== Overview ==
Deciduous  Tree growing to 6 m by 3 m at a medium rate.  It is hardy to zone 4 and is not frost tender.  It is in flower from Jan to April, and the seeds ripen from Sep to October. The flowers are monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) and are pollinated by Wind. It is noted for attracting wildlife.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils.  Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very acid and very alkaline soils. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers moist soil.  The plant can tolerates strong winds but not maritime exposure.

== Characteristics ==
 * form: Standard Tree
 * layer : Lower Canopy
 * habit:  height x width (m): 6 x 3
 * years to bearing nuts : 3-4 yrs
 * productive life span: 50yrs

== Products ==
 * Fruit: Very tasty and nutritious nuts.
 * Wood :  Soft, easy to split, not very durable, beautifully veined. Used for inlay work, small items of furniture, hurdles, wattles, basketry, pea sticks Plants can be grown as a tall hedge. They need to be left untrimmed or only lightly trimmed if seed is required.
 * Medicinal: The bark, leaves, catkins and fruits are sometimes used medicinally

== Functions, behaviours ==
Often grown as a coppiced shrub in woodlands, the stems have a variety of uses A tree that has not been coppiced (a standard) can live for about 60 years, but coppiced can live up to 500. Plants are self-fertile but a more certain crop is obtained if more than one cultivar is grown

== Soil Preparation ==
Because you can expect your hazelnut planting to live and be productive for well over fifty years, the expense of good site preparation will pay off over the long run. Several months before planting, the soil should be tested for P, K and pH, because these are most effective if incorporated into the soil and amending these is easier before planting than after. Amend soil P and K levels according to recommendations for other fruit crops, such as grapes, given in the U of M Bulletin “Nutrient Management for Commercial Fruit and Vegetable Crops in Minnesota” (BU-05886). Although hazelnuts are tolerant of low pH, it is advisable to apply lime if pH is below 5.6, using rates recommended for your state. Use dolomitic lime to supply magnesium if soils test lower than 100 ppm magnesium. It is essential that perennial weeds, such as other woody vegetation, brambles, and quackgrass, be eliminated before planting hazelnuts, ideally the year before. This can be done with a burn-down spray of glyphosate (RoundupTM), followed by plowing a few weeks later, and an additional spray of glyphosate (RoundupTM). For growers who wish not to use herbicides, repetitive plowing can do the same job: plow, and then plow again when regrowth is observed. The down-side to this is that it destroys soil organic matter, may cause soil erosion, and may stimulate germination of annual weeds. If no perennial weeds exist, plowing may be unnecessary. It is possible to simply kill sod with glyphosate (RoundupTM), and plant directly into that, especially if planting will be by hand. For machine planting, however, a well-worked planting bed is essential, especially if following sod, which can interfere with the cutting disks. If the subsoil is compacted, subsoiling is recommended. The anticipated longevity of the planting justifies the cost. Two passes are recommended, one in each direction down the planting row, followed by another operation to smooth the surface. In any case, it is never necessary to till the alleys between rows except in the case of potentially noxious perennial weeds. By leaving the alleys untilled, erosion is better controlled.
