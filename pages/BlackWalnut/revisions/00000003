= Black Walnut - Juglans nigra =
Black walnut trees make a magnificent feature for the larger garden,  typically growing to 30m in height. Mature trees characteristically have long trunks, often without any lower branching while the bark is dark brown and deeply furrowed.  The leaves are late to emerge in spring, early to drop in the autumn and are strongly aromatic when crushed.  The nuts the black walnut produces are simply delicious and the wood it produces is also very highly valued.
