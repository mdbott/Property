= Peach =
Peaches (Prunus persica) and nectarines (Prunus persica var. nectarine) thrive in well-drained soils with a slightly acidic 6.0 to 6.5 pH level. Depending on the variety, both fruits are hardy in USDA zones 5 to 9. Prunus persica Desert Gold and Donut peach cultivars are especially suitable for warmer regions because they do not need the lengthy chilling period that many other peach trees require. Prunus persica var. nectarine Fantasia has yellow, juicy flesh and exceptional flavor, according to Clemson University Cooperative Extension.
