= Black Locust - Robinia pseudoacacia =
Black locust is a rapidly growing, deciduous tree that is native to North America. This member of the pea and bean family (Leguminosae) has now naturalised  in many parts of Europe.  Its hanging clusters of scented, white flowers are well loved by bees that produce an excellent "Acacia" honey. The timber is very hard and rot resistant, making fine fence posts and round wood material.  Its a good tree for establishing on degraded land. It can become invasive due to its prolific seed production, and it also spreads aggressively by suckering from the roots.
