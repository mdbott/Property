= Apple - Malus x Domestica =
Large, fast   growing, native, deciduous tree/shrub producing excellent nuts. Very   attractive in spring when festooned with many long yellow catkins which   are followed by the edible nuts in autumn. The trees make great hedging   and are a classic coppice plant producing pliable stems used for many   purposes such as bean sticks and wattle fencing.

== Functions, behaviours ==
Often grown   as a coppiced shrub in woodlands, the stems have a variety of uses A   tree that has not been coppiced (a standard) can live for about 60   years, but coppiced can live up to 500. Plants are self-fertile but a   more certain crop is obtained if more than one cultivar is grown
