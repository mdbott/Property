= Indian Bean Tree - Catalpa bignonioides =
The Indian bean tree brings an exotic aura to the temperate garden. The beautiful flowers produce copious amounts of nectar for foraging bees. Vigorous growth, producing excellent rot resistant wood, make this a good specie to consider growing in stands on a large scale along with bee hives.  We have 1yr old plants grown from seed that need to be kept inside for their first winter and planted out in spring.

== Context ==
 * native region: South-eastern N. America - Florida, Alabama, Missouri and Louisiana.
 * native habitat: Rich moist soils by the sides of streams and rivers. Can be found growing in derelict sites.
 * family: Bignoniaceae

== Predators ==
 * Brown leaf spots on leaves are often created by the fungi Macrosporium catalpae Powdery mildew causes a white powdery coating on the leaves.

== Needs, tolerances ==
 * Light: Full sun  soil
 * pH:  acid-neutral -basic alkaline  Hardiness Zone: 5 Prefers moist soil Best grown in an open sunny site. The flower buds are formed in autumn and can be excited into premature growth during mild winter weather, this growth is then more susceptible to frost damage.

== Known hazards ==
 * The roots are highly poisonous
 * Can be invasive

== Products ==
 * Wood : Light and rot resistant, used for posts and beams in construction
 * Can be planted on land that is subject to landslips or erosion in order to stabilize the soil.
 * Medicinal:  A tea made from the bark has been used as an antiseptic, antidote to snake bites, laxative, sedative and vermifuge
 * Good Shelterbelt species

== Functions, behaviours ==
 * easy to propagate by seed
 * Flowers from 6-7yrs
 * Trees can be coppiced annually, they will then produce very vigorous growth with leaves up to 1 metre wide.
 * Trees can also be coppiced on longer rotations for use as poles or fire wood.
 * Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus.
 * The flowers are very attractive to bees
