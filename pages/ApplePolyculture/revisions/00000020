= Pome and Stone Fruit Polycultures =
== The central element. ==
In this guild, we’ve chosen an apple tree as the centerpiece, though almost any fruit or small nut tree could be substituted. Usually the central element is a food-producing plant, though other types of guilds may feature wildlife-attracting or nitrogen-fixing trees or perhaps a timber- producer. Apple trees come in many sizes, from thirty-foot-tall standard trees to six-foot minidwarfs, with semistandards, semidwarfs, and dwarf trees in between. All are fine for guilds; but obviously, a small tree won’t support as many associated plants as a big one. The size you choose will be based on your property size, how high you like to reach or climb to harvest, and other similar variables. The tree should be pruned to an open shape to allow light to reach the plants below.

== Grass-suppressing bulbs. ==
The shallow roots of bulbs keep grasses from moving into our guild. Grasses, though planted deliberately by many orchardists, are surface feeders and thus vie for nutrients with trees, whose principal feeding roots also lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside). Eliminating grasses near fruit trees will lessen the need for fertilizer. With less root and nutrient competition, the fruit trees may be more vigorous and grow to their maximum size. Bulbs should be planted in a circle at the drip line of the tree based on its full-grown size. Because spring bulbs curtail their growth in early summer, they won’t rob water from the tree as the heat comes on.

 * Daffodils are particularly useful bulbs, as they contain toxins that  animals abhor. Deer eschew the aboveground parts, and gophers are  repelled by the bulbs. Planting one circle of daffodils around the trunk  and a second thick circle of them at the drip line will temper the  depredations of browsers, burrowers, and bark-chewers.
 * camas
 * alliums (preferably perennial alliums such as
 * garlic,
 * garlic chives
 * ramps
 * wild leek
 * Egyptian onions rather than annual onions)

== Insect- and bird-attracting plants. ==
The tempting blossoms of flowering plants will lure pollinators for boosting fruit set and attract predatory wasps that feast on pestiferous larvae such as borers and codling moths.

 * dill
 * fennel
 * coriander
 * insectary plants described in Chapter 6 and listed in the appendix.

If you want to be a fanatic, the commercial orchardists tell us, select flowers that will bloom just before and after—but not during— apple blossom time, so pollinators will be abundant but not distracted by competing blooms. For home orchards, I suspect this timing is not critical.

== Mulch plants. ==
Growing mulch under the tree eliminates trudging around with a compost-filled wheelbarrow since the guild will build its own soil. Mulch makers include soft-leafed plants such as

 * comfrey
 * artichokes
 * cardoon
 * rhubarb
 * clovers
 * nasturtiums,

all of which can be slashed and left to compost in place. A ring of comfrey around the tree can be hacked down four or five times a summer. As the nutrient-rich greenery rots, it delivers a huge dose of minerals and organic matter to the soil. The resulting thick layer of compost is home to a thriving and diverse population of worms, fungi, bacteria, and other helpful denizens of the soil. This rich and living soil will suppress diseases because the churning soil life competes fiercely for food and habitatbelow the ground. With all the resources divvied up among the soil’s many inhabitants, no one microbial species can get out of balance and become a pest. This means that buildups of harmful fungi such as apple scab are less likely—there are too much competition and too many predators for a single-species population explosion. In contrast, a clean-swept and chemically fertilized orchard floor, devoid of organic matter, ensures that the only fungi able to thrive will be pests since they are adapted to feeding on the one remaining source of food: your trees.

== Nutrient accumulators. ==
Examples of plants that accumulate nutrients are

 * chicory
 * dandelion
 * yarrow
 * plantain, and others found in Table 6-2 (see page 132).

The deep taproots of these plants plunge far into the mineral soil and dredge up important nutrients: potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, and others. As the guild matures, nutrients will begin to recycle within the guild rather than requiring extraction from mineral soil by deep roots. The accumulator plants will then become redundant and begin a natural decline that the gardener can accelerate by pulling them up and replacing them with others.

== Nitrogen fixers. ==
I’ve mentioned the benefits of nitrogen-fixing plants throughout this book, so it should be no surprise that they are a critical component of guilds. Adding nitrogen fixers to guilds is one more way of keeping nutrients cycling within the plant community and reducing the need for fertilizer and other inputs. Since all-important nitrogen is so freely available from the air, it seems silly to be constantly lugging bags of it into our gardens. The list of potential N-fixers for guilds is long and includes

 * clovers
 * alfalfa
 * lupines
 * cowpeas
 * beans
 * peas
 * vetch, and others listed in Table 6-3 (see page 135). Which is best?

I opt for the perennials, such as

 * Dutch or New Zealand white clover
 * alfalfa
 * lupine.

However, many of the others, including vetch and some beans, reseed freely, giving them nearly perennial status. Cowpeas and fava beans are edible, which stacks yet another product into the guild. In late summer, I usually poke one or two dozen fava seeds into the soil beneath each of my fruit trees, and in the following spring I harvest the pods and mulch the stalks in place. Gardeners not similarly blessed with mild winters can start favas in early spring for summer harvest and for mulch material.

I’ve already mentioned another N-fixer strategy, which is to plant a young nitrogen-fixing shrub, such as goumi, bladder senna, or Siberian pea shrub, in the same hole or close to a new fruit tree. Just keep cutting back the shrub to roughly half the size of the tree until the tree is five years old or so and then remove the shrub altogether. It can be left and the pruning continued beyond age five, but the fruit tree’s extensive root network will be drawing nitrogen from a vastly greater area by then. Two or three small N-fixing shrubs can also be placed at or just outside the edges of the mature drip line of the central tree when the guild is created.

== Soil fumigants and pest repellents. ==
Certain plants exude substances that repel pests. Examples are nasturtiums and certain marigolds. Their merits and drawbacks were presented in Chapter 6. Pest-repellent plants are the least understood of the guild members; and, although nasturtiums seem to be useful in guilds, few other pest repellents have been well tested, and they should be used with caution, as they may repel beneficials as well.

== Habitat nooks. ==
Piling up stones, logs, or brush near the apple guild and creating small ponds and puddles will attract lizards, frogs, snakes, and birds. I tucked individual and piled-up rocks unobtrusively around our rural yard, and vast numbers of helpful garter snakes and lizards nested under them. Soon I couldn’t move a rock without uncovering a reptilian home. That was OK—I wanted a ready crew of these beneficial animals for gobbling up slugs, leaf- eating insects, and harmful larvae. Predators such as these are important for preserving balance. If any prey species—caterpillars, aphids, slugs, or the like—finds a home in the lush garden and begins to reproduce exuberantly, a waiting population of predators will cull their numbers with chilling efficiency. These are the roles that should be filled in any guild. Guild design is still a young science: and, as we learn more about the connections necessary to build a thriving plant community, we may need to insert other roles into our guilds. So far, ecological gardeners around the country have had good results from a blend of grass suppressers, insect and bird attractants, nutrient accumulators, mulch plants, nitrogen fixers, soil fumigants, and pest repellents, all surrounding a central food-producer tree
