 . Pome and Stone Fruit Polycultures
 . The central element

 . • The focal productive tree's (Apple,Peach etc) principal feeding roots lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside) and these nutrient grasses vie for these nutrient and water resources.
 . Grass-suppressing bulbs
 . ⇒ Grass-suppressing bulbs. The shallow roots of bulbs keep grasses from moving into our guild.
 . ⇒ Daffodils are particularly useful bulbs, as they contain toxins that animals abhor. Deer eschew the aboveground parts, and gophers are repelled by the bulbs. Planting one circle of daffodils around the trunk and a second thick circle of them at the drip line will temper the depredations of browsers, burrowers, and bark-chewers.
