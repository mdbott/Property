 * The focal productive tree's (Apple,Peach etc) principal feeding roots  lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside) and these nutrient  grasses vie for these nutrient and water resources.

== Grass-suppressing bulbs. ==
The shallow roots of bulbs keep grasses from moving into our guild. Grasses, though planted deliberately by many orchardists, are surface feeders and thus vie for nutrients with trees, whose principal feeding roots also lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside). Eliminating grasses near fruit trees will lessen the need for fertilizer. With less root and nutrient competition, the fruit trees may be more vigorous and grow to their maximum size.
Bulbs should be planted in a circle at the drip line of the tree based on its full-grown size. Because spring bulbs curtail their growth in early summer, they wonâ€™t rob water from the tree as the heat comes on.

 * Daffodils are particularly useful bulbs, as they contain toxins that  animals abhor. Deer eschew the aboveground parts, and gophers are  repelled by the bulbs. Planting one circle of daffodils around the trunk  and a second thick circle of them at the drip line will temper the  depredations of browsers, burrowers, and bark-chewers.
