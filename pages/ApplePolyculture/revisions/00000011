== The central element. ==
 * The focal productive tree's (Apple,Peach etc) principal feeding roots  lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside) and these nutrient  grasses vie for these nutrient and water resources.

== Grass-suppressing bulbs. ==
The shallow roots of bulbs keep grasses from moving into our guild. Grasses, though planted deliberately by many orchardists, are surface feeders and thus vie for nutrients with trees, whose principal feeding roots also lie near the surface (where most nutrients reside). Eliminating grasses near fruit trees will lessen the need for fertilizer. With less root and nutrient competition, the fruit trees may be more vigorous and grow to their maximum size. Bulbs should be planted in a circle at the drip line of the tree based on its full-grown size. Because spring bulbs curtail their growth in early summer, they won’t rob water from the tree as the heat comes on.

 * Daffodils are particularly useful bulbs, as they contain toxins that  animals abhor. Deer eschew the aboveground parts, and gophers are  repelled by the bulbs. Planting one circle of daffodils around the trunk  and a second thick circle of them at the drip line will temper the  depredations of browsers, burrowers, and bark-chewers.
 * camas
 * alliums (preferably perennial alliums such as
 * garlic,
 * garlic chives
 * ramps
 * wild leek
 * Egyptian onions rather than annual onions)

== Insect- and bird-attracting plants. ==
The tempting blossoms of flowering plants will lure pollinators for boosting fruit set and attract predatory wasps that feast on pestiferous larvae such as borers and codling moths.

 * dill
 * fennel
 * coriander
 * insectary plants described in Chapter 6 and listed in the appendix.

If you want to be a fanatic, the commercial orchardists tell us, select flowers that will bloom just before and after—but not during— apple blossom time, so pollinators will be abundant but not distracted by competing blooms. For home orchards, I suspect this timing is not critical.

== Mulch plants. ==
Growing mulch under the tree eliminates trudging around with a compost-filled wheelbarrow since the guild will build its own soil. Mulch makers include soft-leafed plants such as

 * comfrey
 * artichokes
 * cardoon
 * rhubarb
 * clovers
 * nasturtiums,

all of which can be slashed and left to compost in place. A ring of comfrey around the tree can be hacked down four or five times a summer. As the nutrient-rich greenery rots, it delivers a huge dose of minerals and organic matter to the soil. The resulting thick layer of compost is home to a thriving and diverse population of worms, fungi, bacteria, and other helpful denizens of the soil. This rich and living soil will suppress diseases because the churning soil life competes fiercely for food and habitatbelow the ground. With all the resources divvied up among the soil’s many inhabitants, no one microbial species can get out of balance and become a pest. This means that buildups of harmful fungi such as apple scab are less likely—there are too much competition and too many predators for a single-species population explosion. In contrast, a clean-swept and chemically fertilized orchard floor, devoid of organic matter, ensures that the only fungi able to thrive will be pests since they are adapted to feeding on the one remaining source of food: your trees.

== Nutrient accumulators. ==
Examples of plants that accumulate nutrients are

 * chicory
 * dandelion
 * yarrow
 * plantain, and others found in Table 6-2 (see page 132).

The deep taproots of these plants plunge far into the mineral soil and dredge up important nutrients: potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, and others. As the guild matures, nutrients will begin to recycle within the guild rather than requiring extraction from mineral soil by deep roots. The accumulator plants will then become redundant and begin a natural decline that the gardener can accelerate by pulling them up and replacing them with others.

== Nitrogen fixers. ==
