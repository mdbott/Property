=== Codling Moth ===
One of the primary pests for Apple is the codling moth ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codling_moth|Cydia pomonella]]) They are known as an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_pest|agricultural pest]], their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva|larva]] being the common [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple|apple]]  worm or maggot. It is native to Europe and was introduced to North  America, where it has become one of the regular pests of apple orchards.  It is found almost worldwide. It also attacks [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pear|pears]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut|walnuts]], and other tree fruits.The codling moth is greyish with light grey and copper stripes on its  wings, and has an average wingspan of 17 mm. The females lay eggs on  fruit or leaves in summer and the black-headed yellow larvae attack the  fruit immediately upon hatching. Each larva burrows into the fruit, eats  for around three weeks, then leaves the fruit to overwinter and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupate|pupate]] elsewhere in spring and emerge as an adult moth in summer.^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codling_moth#cite_note-1|[1]]]^ Most nourishment is obtained by feeding on the proteinaceous seeds.

Trichogramma are minute wasps, less than 0.5 mm long. The adult female  lays her eggs into moth eggs. When the wasp eggs hatch, the larvae  devour the developing caterpillar inside the moth egg. The trichogramma  larvae pupate and grow into fully formed wasps inside the moth eggs.  These turn charachteristically black as the wasps develop inside.

Wasps emerge by chewing a hole in the moth egg and are then ready to  parasitise other moth eggs. This process takes from seven to ten days,  depending on temperature.

A female wasp can parasitise over fifty moth eggs during her lifespan  of up to 2 weeks. Adult wasps feed on nectar, so it is important to have  some kind of flowers present as a food source. Mated female wasps will produce both male and female offspring. Unmated  females can parasitise eggs but will produce only male offspring. Releases of mass-reared trichogramma in combination with reduced pesticide use complement the natural build-up of beneficials.

Trichogramma wasps have been used to control caterpillar pests in a  wide range of horticultural and field crops throughout Australia.

==== Physical and Cultural Controls ====
 * The apple season is a peak time to work on your organic strategies for codling moth. Inspect the trees every 10 days, collect any fruit you find with small holes and destroy it by immersing it in water for several days. Alternatively place it in a sealed, black plastic bag in the sun, and then try feeding it to poultry.

 * Remove loose bark and leaf debris from the crotch of the tree, to reduce hiding places for cocoons. Corrugated cardboard bands can be placed around trunks and limbs to trap caterpillars looking for a place to pupate. Inspect every 3 weeks and destroy any cocooned caterpillars. The most important trapping time is winter and spring but for effective control inspect the bands all year round.
 * Open-mouthed jars can be filled with a variety of baits to attract codling moth. Try port diluted with water (1 part port to 9 parts water), fermenting apple juice, molasses or oil of cloves. Add a film of vegetable oil to the top to stop moths from escaping and prevent mosquitoes breeding. Hang them in trees in the warmest part of the orchard. Studies have shown codling moth prefer a bait 4-5 days old. Replace the baits every 2 weeks.
 * Light traps, to attract the moths, can be made by suspending a light globe above a pan of water topped with a thin film of kerosene. Research has shown that using overhead irrigation from 7 to 11pm every night for 2 months during the period of intense moth activity reduced fruit injury by 90%. This was related to a climatic study that found rainfall increased larval mortality and decreased egg laying
 * A good choice for the home gardener with only a few apple trees is to bag the fruit. Commercial [[https://www.greenharvest.com.au/PestControlOrganic/ExclusionProducts.html#ClothFruitBags|exclusion bags]] are available in either waxed paper with a built-in twist tie or cloth with a drawstring. Bags should be placed over the fruit while it is very small, first thin the fruit to one piece. It is a good idea to spray before bagging to kill any small caterpillars already present. Bags should be removed 4 days before harvesting to allow the fruit to develop a stronger red colour. A big advantage to exclusion is it usually helps deal with bird and possum problems as well.
 * A [[https://www.greenharvest.com.au/PestControlOrganic/HorticulturalGlueProducts.html|horticultural glue]] such as [[https://www.greenharvest.com.au/PestControlOrganic/HorticulturalGlueProducts.html#Trappit|Trappit Barrier Glue]] or [[https://www.greenharvest.com.au/PestControlOrganic/HorticulturalGlueProducts.html#Tanglefoot|Tanglefoot Glue]] around the trunk of the tree will prevent the movement of some of the female moths from the ground into the tree, as they tend to crawl and flutter up the branches. It should be in place from the first moth sighting until mid-winter. Using the glue below the corrugated cardboard bands will also help to force the larvae looking for a pupation site into the cardboard bands, as it will make it more difficult for them to reach the ground.
